# SpaceMongers

**A Simple API wrapper for https://spacetraders.io**

Features:
* Covers all endpoints
* Automatic rate limiting to avoid overloading the servers and getting banned
* Fields deserialized into native types

## Installation

SpaceMongers can be installed by adding `space_mongers` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:space_mongers, "~> 0.3.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

### Obtaining a username and token

For most requests, you will need an authenticated client which requires you to pass a username and token. You can claim a username and token with the following code:

```elixir
{:ok, %{user: %{username: username}, token: token}} = SpaceMongers.claim_username("my_username")
```

### Creating a client

You will need an authenticated client in order to make requests.

```elixir
client = SpaceMongers.ApiClient.new(username, token)
```

### Making requests

A variety of requests can be found in the root `SpaceMongers` module. These mostly require having an authenticated API client as the first argument. 

#### Examples

Get the status of the servers:
```elixir
> SpaceMongers.status()

{:ok, "spacetraders is currently online and available to play"}
```

View your user:
```elixir
> SpaceMongers.current_user(client)

 {:ok,
